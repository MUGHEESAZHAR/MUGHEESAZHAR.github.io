    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      This website demonstrates the use of semantic HTML with minimal CSS.
      It explains three key Human–Computer Interaction models: Norman’s Action Cycle,
      GOMS, and the Keystroke-Level Model (KLM).

    <h2>What is Human–Computer Interaction (HCI)</h2>
    <p>
      Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) focuses on the design, evaluation,
      and implementation of interactive systems for human use.
      It studies how users interact with systems and how interfaces can
      be designed to support users’ tasks effectively.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Norman’s Action Cycle</h2>
    <p>
      Norman’s Action Cycle explains how users interact with a system through
      stages such as goal formation, execution, and evaluation.
      It highlights the gulfs of execution and evaluation, which describe
      difficulties users may face when using an interface.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>GOMS Model</h2>
    <p>
      GOMS stands for Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection Rules.
      It is used to analyze expert user performance by breaking tasks
      into structured components and understanding how goals are achieved.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Keystroke-Level Model (KLM)</h2>
    <p>
      KLM is a simplified version of GOMS that predicts task execution time.
      It focuses on low-level actions such as keystrokes, pointing, and mental preparation,
      assuming expert and error-free user behavior.
